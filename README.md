Use the read me to indicate what work still needs to be done. 
When you commit changes only commit to your branch, and specify what was done in that change so I can merge to master.
If you commit broken code make sure that its clear in the commit message and in the code. 
Place graphics in the photos folder.
To update the Readme you will need to click create pull request so it can be merged to master.
Write what you plan to work on below so there isn't overlap
